# Peachy Keen 32
Name is inspired by my girlfriend that just gave me a Monster Peachy Keen (<3) which is so good that I had to write a shell in ARM.


## Awesome features

### Command support

**fwrite**\n

`usage fwrite "string to write to file" filename`

*fwrite currently allows you to write a string to a file, if the file doesn't exist it will create it for you. I know cool right? ^~^*
